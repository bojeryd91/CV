\position{Ph.D. Candidate at UCLA}{2018--present}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Conducted several empirical studies using large corporate and administrative household datasets. Solved complex life-cycle models using recent innovations in computational methods.
    %
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textit{Paper 1:} I estimate the impact of changing home prices on workers' propensity to relocate following economic shocks to their current labor market, using a continuous difference-in-difference model (\texttt{in Stata}). I further analyze the channels at work by solving a spatial life-cycle model with decisions of location, housing, and wealth accumulation (\texttt{in Julia}).
        %
        \item \textit{Paper 2:} I study the impact of U.S. QE on corporate bond prices and firm outcomes by using high-frequency corporate bond data (TRACE) and an event-study methodology (\texttt{in R}, Compustat).
        %
        \item \textit{Paper 3:} We analyze how auto purchases are affected when mortgage access declines following a fall in home prices, using a difference-in-difference setting. We estimate a two-sample IV regression model (\texttt{in Stata}) and solve a complex household model (\texttt{in Julia}).
        %
        \item \textit{For complete list of papers}, \uline{\href{https://www.jesperbojeryd.se/research}{see website}}.
    \end{itemize}
    %
    \item Managed research assistants and projects with co-authors across several institutions and countries.
    %
    \item Collaborated with private firms to construct novel datasets combined with Swedish administrative data.
    %
    \item Taught extensively at the undergraduate and graduate levels. \quad (\uline{\href{https://www.jesperbojeryd.se/teaching}{Link to evals}})
    %
    \item Collaborated with Stata Corp debugging and resolving a bug. The fix was shipped in an official update of Stata 17. Similar collaboration for the user-written \texttt{boottest}.
\end{itemize}

\position{Ph.D. Intern and Guest Researcher, Norges Bank}{2022--present}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Paper 4:} Conducted a co-authored project with central-bank researchers studying household-level expenditures in response to shocks to home prices. We use the near-universe of digital payments in Norway combined with rich administrative data.
    \item Presented work for the Norges Bank Research Department and policymakers.
\end{itemize}


\medskip

\position{Thomas J. Sargent Dissertation Fellow at the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco}{2023}


\begin{itemize}
    \item Received fellowship and access to the bank's researchers to continue research on my dissertation.
    \item Presented solo-authored work twice to the research department and discussed research with Fed and guest researchers.
\end{itemize}


\medskip

\position{Research Assistant at The Riksbank and the Swedish House of Finance}{2015--2018}

\begin{itemize}
    \item Collected and analyzed corporate and household credit data, health data (\texttt{in Stata}) and wrote code for data scraping (\texttt{in Python}).
    \item Utilized various econometric methods, including difference-in-difference and instrumental variable regressions.
    \item Contributed to six published articles on credit use, health economics, and labor economics.
    \begin{itemize}
