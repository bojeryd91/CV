% The datetabular environment takes one argument, which is the width of the left date column. As seen here:
%   9em is a good choice for "dual-date" formats (e.g. Sep 2015 - Nov 2019).
%   4em is a good choice for month/year dates (Sep 2014).
%   2em is a good choice for year-only dates (as seen in the publications)

\href{https://www.jesperbojeryd.se/jmp}{\textbf{Should I stay or should I go? The role of housing in understanding limited inter-regional worker mobility}} (\href{https://www.jesperbojeryd.se/jmp}{Latest version can be found at \texttt{www.jesperbojeryd.se/jmp}})}

Our understanding why workers are slow to leave places in economic decline is limited but is important in the design of policy. Using Norwegian administrative data on workers in the oil-producing Stavanger region and the 2014 plunge in global oil prices, I empirically document that workers' housing wealth is a key variable in explaining who stays or goes. I show that workers with little or no housing wealth left the region at a higher rate following the shock while homeowners with more housing wealth were more likely to stay. The richness of the data allows me to control for potentially confounding factors and selection into housing tenure. Using a life-cycle model with endogenous location, housing, and saving choices as well as home prices, I show that the value of moving is reduced for homeowners when home prices fall in response to a negative labor demand shock and that they are worse off by staying compared to renters. Renters are compensated by a rent reduction. On net, the difference in locations' present values for homeowners increases less than for renters, who therefore move more. The model also shows that moving subsidies are more effective at stimulating renter migration, indicating that untargeted subsidies do not reach the worst impacted workers.

%We estimate the housing wealth effect on car consumption by using an unexpected announcement of the continuation of Bromma Airport outside Stockholm. Affected households lost 19\% house wealth relative to households outside the airport noise zone, and we find a reduction in the price of new cars affected households buy in the following year and no change on the extensive margin. By studying credit use, we find that the reduction in equity-withdrawal capacity is the driving force rather than changes in lifetime wealth. Our findings are consistent with a calibrated life-cycle model.

%Since the Financial Crisis, quantitative easing has become a standard monetary policy tool. We ask how the Federal Reserve's QE programs during the 2010--2020s heterogeneously affected public firms' borrowing costs in the corporate bond market and if it influenced real outcomes. Results are ambiguous and indicate very small effects where dividends stand out to be most positively affected.

%Using the near-universe of digital transactions, we study how public sector employees and retirees responded to falls in home prices in Stavanger, Norway, compared to similar households in other parts of Norway following the oil price plunge of 2014--2016. We find overall small effects on consumption, which are concentrated to durable expenditures such as furniture and car purchases. The effects are also greater for more indebted households.
