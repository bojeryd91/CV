% The datetabular environment takes one argument, which is the width of the left date column. As seen here:
%   9em is a good choice for "dual-date" formats (e.g. Sep 2015 - Nov 2019).
%   4em is a good choice for month/year dates (Sep 2014).
%   2em is a good choice for year-only dates (as seen in the publications)
\begin{datetabular}{6em}
% This is just a tabular environment, for the most part. The dateentry command has been defined for
% convenience. It takes two arguments, the first is the date and the second is whatever you wish placed to the right.

\section{Ongoing work}

\textbf{Car purchases, indebtedness and monetary policy}

Through a full-population panel for Sweden 1995--2015, I study how monetary policy affects new and used car consumption.

\medskip

\textbf{The Housing Wealth Effect: Quasi-Experimental Evidence}, with Dany Kessel, Björn Tyrefors, and Roine Vestman

Our paper estimates the house price effect on car consumption by using an unexpected announcement of the continuation of Bromma Airport outside Stockholm. Affected households lost 15\% house wealth relative households outside the airport noise zone, and we find a reduction in the price of new cars affected households buy in the following years. The extensive margin is not affected. We disentangle the channels at work by empirically studying borrowing behavior and through the lens of a calibrated life-cycle model which replicates most of our findings.

\medskip

\textbf{Heterogeneous Effects of QE on Corporate Bonds and Firm Outcomes}, with Adam Baybutt

Since the Financial Crisis, quantitative easing has become a standard tool of monetary policy. We ask how the Federal Reserve's QE programs during the 2010--2020s heterogeneously affected public firms' borrowing cost in the corporate bond market and if it influenced real outcomes. Results are so far ambiguous and indicate very small effects where dividends stand out to be mostly positively affected. Currently we are exploring Covid 19-related QE.
