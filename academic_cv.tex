% The datetabular environment takes one argument, which is the width of the left date column. As seen here:
%   9em is a good choice for "dual-date" formats (e.g. Sep 2015 - Nov 2019).
%   4em is a good choice for month/year dates (Sep 2014).
%   2em is a good choice for year-only dates (as seen in the publications)
\begin{datetabular}{\datetabspace}
% This is just a tabular environment, for the most part. The dateentry command has been defined for

\href{https://roinevestman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DP18034-compressed.pdf}{\textbf{The Housing Wealth Effect: Quasi-Experimental Evidence}}, \emph{with Dany Kessel, Björn Tyrefors, and Roine Vestman (\href{https://roinevestman.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/DP18034-compressed.pdf}{Latest version can be found \underline{here}})}

We estimate the housing wealth effect on car consumption by using an unexpected announcement of the continuation of Bromma Airport outside Stockholm. Affected households lost 19\% house wealth relative to households outside the airport noise zone, and we find a reduction in the price of new cars affected households buy in the following year and no change on the extensive margin. By studying credit use, we find that the reduction in equity-withdrawal capacity is the driving force rather than changes in lifetime wealth. Our findings are consistent with a calibrated life-cycle model.

Since the Financial Crisis, quantitative easing has become a standard monetary policy tool. We ask how the Federal Reserve's QE programs during the 2010--2020s heterogeneously affected public firms' borrowing costs in the corporate bond market and if it influenced real outcomes. Results are ambiguous and indicate very small effects where dividends stand out to be most positively affected.


\section{Work in progress}


\textbf{(JMP) Should I Stay or Should I Go? Migration in Response to Changing Economic Conditions}

Moving costs are an important element of spatial decision models to explain the limited migration responses to regional economic shocks, but our understanding of the underlying factors is limited. I empirically document the heterogeneous frictions of migration using the 2014 plunge in global oil prices as a persistent, negative shock to the expected income of workers in the oil region of Stavanger, Norway. The leaving probabilities of renters and young people increase while the probability decreases for homeowners. The arrival probability falls for all groups with the exception of low-income people with immediate family in the region. The findings explain the long-term changes in population composition of locations in economic decline. I show that these findings are consistent with a life-cycle model with location, housing choices, and heterogeneous moving costs. Homeowners migrate out less due to the negative shock to their housing wealth while cheaper housing skews the inflow toward low-income people with family ties in the region.

\textbf{What Do 12 Billion Card Transactions Say About House Prices and Consumption?}, \emph{with Knut Are Aastveit, Magnus Gulbrandsen, Ragnar Juelsrud, and Kasper Roszbach}

Using the near-universe of digital transactions, we study how public sector employees and retirees responded to falls in home prices in Stavanger, Norway, compared to similar households in other parts of Norway following the oil price plunge of 2014--2016. We find overall small effects on consumption, which are concentrated to durable expenditures such as furniture and car purchases. The effects are also greater for more indebted households.

\medskip

\textbf{Durable expenditures, Indebtedness, and Monetary Policy}

Through a full-population panel for Sweden 1995--2015, I study how monetary policy affects new and used car purchases. To be extended with housing transactions.
